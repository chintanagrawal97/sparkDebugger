#Welcome to my site 

My name is [Szabo Daniel Erno](http://r3ap3rpy.pythonanywhere.com/). I'm a young pythonista doing stuff mostly with python and powershell. I started to learn this language in 2014 back in the network administrator days of mine.

I have a nice collection of git [repositories](https://github.com/r3ap3rpy)

A [youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1qkMXH8d2I9DDAtBSeEHqg) channel.

And I'm an instructor on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com).

# About the gears of this site

Query strings and 404 are redirected to the default context root.

This site is powered by the [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) module of python, and the [markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) modules. The [Jinja2]() template engine is used by default the the **css** was repurposed from the [egoist](https://github.com/egoist/hack).

This is a powerful concept because everything you see rendered here is from a markdown file and the added value of this site also comes from the concept. 

# Support for code highliting

```python
import this
for i in range(10):
	print(i)
```

# Support for image and youtube embedding

# How this site works?

There is a folder in the **appdir** called **md** that is used to generate context roots and the contents of those folders are rendered as separated paragraphs. 

It is expected that you use markdown.

# You can also add or remove new folders with the [foldermanager](/foldermanager) or add/remove pages via [pagemanager](/pagemanager)
